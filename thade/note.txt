- Bot always log despite self.track() is ran or not. Either through txt files or through database
- Bot's name must be a WORD having less then 34 characters
- Bot always runs the next record  not on the self.last_update_record. Therefore, At least 2 records is computed every run.
- One major problem, I have is that fee is a decimal number (0.0035)
which leads to the balance becoming a decimal number.
    => Current solution is to set all balance-related* attributes to Decimal under the hood.
    Bot continues taking int balance then cast to Decimal balance.

* balance-related attributes include balance, control_balance, all_time_min_total_vnd, all_time_max_total_vnd
